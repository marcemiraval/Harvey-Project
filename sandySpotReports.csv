40.5,-75.7,416921,68481,PENNSYLVANIA,Flood,EST-5,"Post Tropical Storm Sandy caused an initial estimate of $20 million dollars in damage in Pennsylvania and directly or indirectly caused 15 deaths across the state. Most of the damage in the eastern part of the state was wind related as wind gusts reached as high as 81 mph. Some moderate creek flooding occurred in the southeast part of the state and record tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River. Hundreds of roads were closed because of downed trees and major transportation in and out of the region was halted for two days and only slowly returned starting on the 31st. PECO Energy which serves customers in southeastern Pennsylvania, broke their all-time outage record of 850,000 customers without power. At any one time, the greatest number of statewide outages was approximately 1.2 million utility customers on the 30th. In the Mount Holly warning and forecast area of Eastern Pennsylvania, Sandy was responsible for eleven deaths, one that was considered directly caused by the system: a Berks County man was killed by a falling tree. Hardest hit with wind damage were Lehigh and Montgomery Counties. Chester and Delaware Counties were most affected by creek flooding.||Governor Tom Corbett declared a state of disaster emergency for Pennsylvania as did Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia.

After drifting slowly southwest into the 23rd, Sandy turned to the north and intensified to a hurricane on the 24th just before making landfall in Jamaica during that afternoon. Hurricane Sandy continued to the north and intensified to a strong category two hurricane before making landfall again in Cuba shortly after Midnight EDT on the 25th.  Hurricane Sandy emerged on the other side of Cuba during the morning of the 25th and proceeded to drift northwest as a category one or two hurricane as it moved through the Bahamas on the 25th and 26th.  Overnight on the 26th, Hurricane Sandy (Category 1) started to move toward the north-northeast, a motion that continued into the evening of the 28th.  From there, Sandy???s motion became driven by two factors. An anomalously strong blocking ridge over the Canadian Maritimes prevented Sandy from escaping to the east.  Simultaneously, an approaching and deepening middle latitude trough was about to capture Sandy.

As Sandy continued to move northwest and interact with the mid latitude trough,  its interaction continued to make it less tropical, but did not weaken it much. Sandy continued to make a harder turn to the left (west) and made landfall in Atlantic County as a post tropical storm in Brigantine City just north of  Atlantic City at 730  p.m. EDT on the 29th.  The estimated minimum central pressure was  945 millibars. The lowest recorded central pressure was 945.6 millibars at the Atlantic City Marina at 734 p.m. EDT.   From there, Sandy continued to weaken or fill as it moved west.  At 9 p.m. EDT, the low pressure system was in western Atlantic County and continued to move west-northwest. At 11 p.m. EDT, the post tropical storm (about 954 millibars) was located in southern Chester County.  Post tropical storm Sandy continued to move west-northwest and weaken. At 2 a.m. EDT on the 30th, the 962 millibar low was located near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and at 8 a.m. EDT the 979 millibar low was near Altoona, Pennsylvania.

The lowest recorded central pressure of 940 millibars (27.76 inches) occurred when Category 1 Hurricane Sandy was about 110 miles southeast of Atlantic City at 2 p.m. EDT on the 29th. As Sandy continued to move northwest and interact with the mid latitude trough, its interaction continued to make it less tropical, but did not weaken it much. Sandy continued to make a harder turn to the left (west) and made landfall in Atlantic County as a post tropical storm in Brigantine City just north of Atlantic City at 730 p.m. EDT on the 29th. The estimated minimum central pressure was 945 millibars. The lowest recorded central pressure was 945.6 millibars at the Atlantic City Marina at 734 p.m. EDT. From there, Sandy continued to weaken or fill as it moved west. At 9 p.m. EDT, the low pressure system was in western Atlantic County and continued to move west-northwest. At 11 p.m. EDT, the post tropical storm (about 954 millibars) was located in southern Chester County. Post tropical storm Sandy continued to move west-northwest and weaken. At 2 a.m. EDT on the 30th, the 962 millibar low was located near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and at 8 a.m. EDT the 979 millibar low was near Altoona, Pennsylvania. From there, the rapidly weakening low pressure system moved northwest and reached Lake Erie (993 millibars) at 8 p.m. EDT that evening and from there drifted nor...","The heavy rain that fell across central and southern Ocean County not only caused poor drainage flooding, but exacerbated the tidal flooding along Barnegat Bay and on the barrier islands.

High latitude blocking over the North Atlantic and the interaction with a strong upper-air disturbance over the central Appalachians allowed Sandy to take a sharp left turn and accelerate northwest from the western Atlantic into southern New Jersey and across southern Pennsylvania. The center of post-tropical Sandy moved westward across the state beginning late in the evening on the 29th. The remnants of Sandy, a weakening low pressure system, exited northwestern Pennsylvania into Canada on October 31, 2012. ||The highest recorded storm-total rainfall amount obtained in PA for the Oct 28-31, 2012 period was 7.94 inches at Schellsburg 2.6 WNW in Bedford County.  There was an unconfirmed report of 8.15 inches at Hanover 5.4 S in York County which has not been verified. There was widespread storm-total rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches over the central and south portions of the Commonwealth with locally up to near 8 inches along the MD border region. However despite the heavy rainfall, hydrologic impacts were rather limited.  Most of the significant flooding occurred in the southern most counties bordering Maryland, where the heaviest rainfall totals occurred.  Areal Flood Warnings and Advisories were issued for the region. Six river forecast points rose above flood stage, with all but the Conestoga River at Lancaster (with moderate flooding) experiencing minor flood crests. ||The impacts from the strong winds were widespread, with peak wind gusts were measured in the 50 to 60 mph range. High wind watches and warnings were issued well in advance of the storm. There were several reports of roof and other minor structural damage to homes and businesses. Widespread reports of trees down and power lines down were received. Wind damage caused significant power outages at the height of the storm.  ||Cold air was drawn into the southwest-side of the storm and produced heavy snows from October 29-31 across the southern Laurel Mountains.  Amounts in excess of a foot were reported at several locations over the highest elevations including 14 inches at Laurel Summit in Somerset County. The ridges in Cambria County received between 2 and 4 inches. ||There was one indirect storm-related fatality that occurred on the evening of the 29th. A person was killed in a Somerset County traffic accident, when their car slid off snow and slush covered road into a farm pond.||A disaster emergency was issued by the Governor on October 26, 2012. This was followed by a Presidential Emergency Declaration on October 29, 2012. ||In summary, Superstorm Sandy was an enduring late season tropical cyclone which developed during a period of high-latitude blocking over the Atlantic Basin. The storm came ashore in New Jersey with significant impact to the coastal regions of the Mid-Atlantic states. The interaction of hurricane Sandy with a strong upper-air disturbance produced one of the more memorable and destructive storms in the Mid-Atlantic region in over 100 years.","Heavy rainfall brought widespread flooding to Adams County.

Easterly winds gusted to 50 to 60 mph for interior southern New England; 55 to 65 mph along the eastern Massachusetts coast and along the I-95 corridor in southeast Massachusetts and Rhode Island; and 70 to 80 mph along the southeast Massachusetts and Rhode Island coasts.  A few higher higher gusts occurred along the Rhode Island coast.  A severe thunderstorm embedded in an outer band associated with Sandy produced wind gusts to 90 mph and concentrated damage in Wareham early Tuesday evening, |a day after the center of Sandy had moved into New Jersey.  In general, moderate coastal flooding occurred along the Massachusetts coastline, and major coastal flooding impacted the Rhode Island coastline.  The storm surge was generally 2.5 to 4.5 feet along the east coast of Massachusetts, but peaked late Monday afternoon in between high tide cycles.  Seas built to between 20 and 25 feet Monday afternoon and evening just off the Massachusetts east coast.  Along the south coast, the storm surge was 4 to 6 feet and seas from 30 to a little over 35 feet were observed in the outer coastal waters.  The very large waves on top of the storm surge caused destructive coastal flooding along stretches of the Rhode Island exposed south coast.  ||Sandy grew into a hurricane over the southwest Caribbean and then headed north across Jamaica, Cuba, and the Bahamas.  As Sandy headed north of the Bahamas, the storm interacted with a vigorous weather system moving west to east across the United States and began to take on a hybrid structure.  Strong high pressure over southeast Canada helped with the expansion of the strong winds well north of the center of Sandy.  In essence, Sandy retained the structure of a hurricane near its center (until shortly before landfall) while taking on more of an extra-tropical cyclone configuration well away from the center.  Sandy???s track was unusual.  The storm headed northeast and then north across the western Atlantic and then sharply turned to the west to make landfall near Atlantic City, NJ during Monday evening.  Sandy subsequently weakened and moved west across southern Pennsylvania on Tuesday before turning north and heading across western New York state into Quebec during Tuesday night and Wednesday.","In Revere, eighteen inches of water flooded Bell Circle.

High latitude blocking over the North Atlantic and the interaction with a strong upper-air disturbance over the central Appalachians allowed Sandy to take a sharp left turn and accelerate northwest from the western Atlantic into southern New Jersey and across southern Pennsylvania.

A band of heavy rain and high winds associated with Sandy moved northward into New Hampshire Monday afternoon and continued moving northward through the State Monday night.  The high winds associated with this band of heavy rain downed numerous trees and caused widespread power outages.  In addition, the heavy rains caused some road washouts in the State. By Tuesday, the remnants of Sandy had moved into western Pennsylvania, but the circulation around the weakening storm continued to bring tropical air into the region during the day Tuesday and into Wednesday.  Localized heavy showers and thunderstorms developed in this tropical airmass Tuesday and Tuesday evening.  Several of these thunderstorms produced damaging winds Tuesday evening. The shower activity diminished during the day Wednesday as cooler air moved into the region.||Winds across much of the State generally gusted from 40 to 70 mph Monday and Monday night.  These strong and persistent winds combined with the powerful gusts to down numerous trees throughout the State and caused widespread power outages, especially across southern New Hampshire.  Some peak wind gusts included 70 mph in Goshen, 62 mph in Londonderry, 60 mph in Portsmouth and Meredith, and between 50 and 60 mph in Concord, Derry, Newington, Fremont, and Rochester.  Mount Washington had a gust of 136 mph and the Isles of Shoals gusted to 76 mph.  In addition, on Tuesday, thunderstorm wind downed trees and produced damage in Northfield, Franklin, Andover, Plymouth, Meredith, and Canaan.||The most significant hydrological impact from the storm was due to the band of heavy rain that fell between Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning.  Across the State, this band produced 1 to 3 inches of rain in about a 6- to 12-hour period.  This amount of heavy rain in the short duration caused some  road washouts in the State.  In the southeastern side of the White Mountains, rainfall totals during the 12-hour period were between 3 and 5 inches.  Over the 48-hour period from 8 am Monday to 8 am Wednesday, rainfall Sandy totaled from 2 to 4 inches across much of the State with the southeastern slopes of the White Mountains generally reporting from 3 to 6 inches.  One reporting site in Gorham reported more than 8 inches of rain during the 48 hour period.  One man was killed in a mudslide caused by heavy rain. He was standing 5 feet from the edge of a 10-15 ft high embankment at a building site located on the steep slope of a mountain. Heavy rains from Sandy caused the embankment to collapsed causing a mudslide. The victim was caught in the mudslide and was washed into a ravine along with mud and boulders. Cause of death was attributed to blunt trauma to the head and suffocation due to the inhalation of mud and water.||Minor flooding was also reported on a couple rivers in the State.  In Conway, the Saco River rose to 10.59 feet, 1.59 feet above flood stage.  In Woodstock, the Pemigewasset River rose to 10.06 feet, 1.06 feet above flood level.||Severe convection developed across southern New Hampshire Tuesday evening, the 30th, and knocked over trees and/or caused damage in Meredith, Plymouth, Canaan, Andover, Franklin, and Northfield.",A man was standing 5 feet from the edge of a 10-15 ft high embankment at a building site located on the steep slope of a mountain.

41.42,-81.66,412639,68788,OHIO,Flood,EST-5,"Superstorm Sandy brought record rainfall and major flooding to northern portions of Ohio in late October 2012. The flooding was the result of three consecutive weather events; a cold front, hurricane Sandy remnants, and lake enhanced showers. Rain started on October 26th as a slow moving cold front moved into the Ohio Valley. This front brought widespread 0.75 to 2.0 inches of rainfall to northern Ohio, highest near the lake. This rainfall did not produce flooding, but it raised streamflows and reduced flash flood guidance to around 1 inch for 6 hours. ||By Monday the remnants of Hurricane Sandy moved into Pennsylvania, and the pressure gradient between it and high pressure over Missouri produced storm force winds over Lake Erie. Moisture from Sandy moved into the region producing an additional rainfall of 2 to 3 inches by Tuesday the 30th.  Rain continued at a rate averaging 0.1-0.2??? per hour for the day, but increased to 0.75??? per hour overnight and early Wednesday morning. This band of heavier rain caused the rivers which were receding to once again rise. ||Areal flooding was limited to more northern counties; however some small streams and creeks came out of their banks as far south as Ashland County. Numerous roads were closed due to flooding over Cuyahoga, Lake, and Medina Counties from the persistent rain.
