Summary
========================================================


My research seeks to understand where, when and how individuals report information about weather-related disaster events, and how groups with different training levels report the facts. 

This understanding will help to design procedures to control the quality of weather-related disaster reports as well as inform how people's reports can be best used to assess local effects of weather-related disaster events in order to calibrate forecasts and warnings.



Outline Of The Chapters
========================================================

- Chapter 1. Evaluates the importance of considering the spatio-temporal distribution of Twitter reports in the analysis of content of those related to weather-related disaster events.
“Leveraging Spatio-Temporal Information to Enrich Thematic Clustering of Twitter Posts”

- Chapter 2. Addresses the data quality of Twitter reports on weather-related disaster events by estimating the correspondence between this type of reports and those contributed by trained citizens.

- Chapter 3.
