Some of these storms redeveloped over the same areas, most notably in central Swisher County where Tulia and the nearby Middle Tule Creek experienced flash flooding from over four inches of rain in less than one hour. In Hockley County, a favorable merger of outflow boundaries supported a rotating thunderstorm that produced a swath of damaging winds and flash flooding. In addition to damaging several power poles and a Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet, this storm produced incredible rainfall rates measured as great as 0.69 inches in 5 minutes, or 8.28 inches per hour.","Tropical Storm Harvey emerged back over the Northwest Gulf of Mexico during the morning hours of August 28th, and intensified slightly as drifted northwest just off the Southeast Texas coast, eventually making a 3rd landfall near Cameron, Louisiana during the early morning hours of August 30th. The persistent outer bands of Tropical Storm Harvey began consistently affecting Angelina County, Texas during the afternoon and evening of August 27th, with persistent training resulting in flash flooding. Breaks in the heavy rain were observed through much of the 28th before affecting Angelina County again during the late afternoon/evening hours, which continued through the early morning hours on August 29th. After Harvey made landfall in far Southwest Louisiana during the early morning hours of August 30th, the more concentrated bands of heavy rain were concentrated on the northwest side of the center, which slowly drifted northeast into Central Louisiana during the afternoon and evening hours. Thus, more significant reports of flash flooding were received across Deep East Texas and Westcentral Louisiana, before drier air had begun to wrap around the center, thus reducing rainfall rates as the center moved into Northeast Louisiana during the early morning hours of August 31st. In addition to the widespread flooding, reports of downed trees and power lines were received over portions of Deep East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana, as some of the stronger squalls produced wind gusts to 35-40 mph with locally higher gusts atop already saturated grounds.||Here are some of the 4 day cumulative rainfall reports across Deep East Texas from Tropical Storm Harvey: In Angelina County, 2 ESE Zavalla 20.27 inches, 2 ENE Zavalla 17.32 inches, Huntington 13.94 inches, Lufkin Angelina Airport 12.11 inches, 1 SSE Lufkin 11.96 inches, 3 SW Lufkin 11.74 inches, 8 W Lufkin 10.17 inches, 5 WNW Lufkin 10.00 inches, 7 W Lufkin 9.60 inches, 2 WSW Hudson 9.09 inches.

Harvey moved inland entering southern DeWitt County during the morning of August 26th  as a Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken as it moved farther inland eventually reaching south central Gonzales County as a tropical storm during the late evening of August 26th. The center of the storm made a loop through Gonzales, Karnes, and DeWitt Counties before exiting our County Warning Area during the afternoon of August 27th moving into Victoria County. The maximum sustained winds were 46 mph recorded at Austin Bergstrom International Airport and at two private weather stations, one near Yorktown and the other near Smiley. The maximum recorded wind gusts were 58 mph at New Braunfels Airport, Randolph AFB, and at a private weather station near Smiley. The highest rainfall total was 29.19 inches outside of LaGrange in Fayette County. A number of places in Fayette, Lavaca, and Bastrop Counties received 20 or more inches of rain. Tropical storm force winds with estimated gusts up to 60 mph caused damage across the region. Trees and branches were knocked down by the winds. Some of these in turn knocked down power lines causing power outages in Bastrop, Comal, Hays, and Guadalupe Counties. At one point, 15,000 customers in Comal County were without power. There was also some minor structural damage in Caldwell, Comal, and Lavaca Counties. Maximum rainfall totals in these counties ranged from 4.67 inches in Bexar to 29.19 in Fayette. Flooding and flash flooding forced 608 people to be evacuated from their homes. Most of these, 400, were in Fayette County.","Hurricane Harvey moved onshore as a Category 4 hurricane over San Jose Island east of Rockport during the late evening of August 25th.

In addition to the widespread flooding, reports of downed trees and power lines were received over portions of Deep East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana, as some of the stronger squalls produced wind gusts to 35-40 mph with locally higher gusts atop already saturated grounds.||Here are some of the 4 day cumulative rainfall reports across Deep East Texas from Tropical Storm Harvey: In Angelina County, 2 ESE Zavalla 20.27 inches, 2 ENE Zavalla 17.32 inches, Huntington 13.94 inches, Lufkin Angelina Airport 12.11 inches, 1 SSE Lufkin 11.96 inches, 3 SW Lufkin 11.74 inches, 8 W Lufkin 10.17 inches, 5 WNW Lufkin 10.00 inches, 7 W Lufkin 9.60 inches, 2 WSW Hudson 9.09 inches.

Over that 5 day period over Southeast Texas TS Harvey produced catastrophic flooding with a large area of 30 to 60 inches of rain, 23 tornadoes, tropical storm force winds and a moderate storm surge near Matagorda Bay.  In some of the heavier bands rain fell at a rate of over 5 inches per hour. This copious record amount of rain over a  led to catastrophic flooding. Thousands of homes, businesses, and roads were flooded due to flash flooding and sheet flow from long duration intense rain. Main stem rivers and adjoining tributaries, creeks and bayous reached full capacity and came out of their banks and this also contributed to the massive flooding across southeastern Texas.","Harvey made landfall as a category 4 hurricane near Rockport, Texas during the evening of August 25th.

Harvey moved inland entering southern DeWitt County during the morning of August 26th  as a Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken as it moved farther inland eventually reaching south central Gonzales County as a tropical storm during the late evening of August 26th. The center of the storm made a loop through Gonzales, Karnes, and DeWitt Counties before exiting our County Warning Area during the afternoon of August 27th moving into Victoria County. The maximum sustained winds were 46 mph recorded at Austin Bergstrom International Airport and at two private weather stations, one near Yorktown and the other near Smiley. The maximum recorded wind gusts were 58 mph at New Braunfels Airport, Randolph AFB, and at a private weather station near Smiley. The highest rainfall total was 29.19 inches outside of LaGrange in Fayette County. A number of places in Fayette, Lavaca, and Bastrop Counties received 20 or more inches of rain. Tropical storm force winds with estimated gusts up to 60 mph caused damage across the region. Trees and branches were knocked down by the winds. Some of these in turn knocked down power lines causing power outages in Bastrop, Comal, Hays, and Guadalupe Counties. At one point, 15,000 customers in Comal County were without power. There was also some minor structural damage in Caldwell, Comal, and Lavaca Counties. Maximum rainfall totals in these counties ranged from 4.67 inches in Bexar to 29.19 in Fayette. Flooding and flash flooding forced 608 people to be evacuated from their homes. Most of these, 400, were in Fayette County.","Hurricane Harvey moved onshore as a Category 4 hurricane over San Jose Island east of Rockport during the late evening of August 25th.

It continued to weaken as it moved farther inland eventually reaching south central Gonzales County as a tropical storm during the late evening of August 26th. The center of the storm made a loop through Gonzales, Karnes, and DeWitt Counties before exiting our County Warning Area during the afternoon of August 27th moving into Victoria County. The maximum sustained winds were 46 mph recorded at Austin Bergstrom International Airport and at two private weather stations, one near Yorktown and the other near Smiley. The maximum recorded wind gusts were 58 mph at New Braunfels Airport, Randolph AFB, and at a private weather station near Smiley. The highest rainfall total was 29.19 inches outside of LaGrange in Fayette County. A number of places in Fayette, Lavaca, and Bastrop Counties received 20 or more inches of rain. Tropical storm force winds with estimated gusts up to 60 mph caused damage across the region. Trees and branches were knocked down by the winds. Some of these in turn knocked down power lines causing power outages in Bastrop, Comal, Hays, and Guadalupe Counties. At one point, 15,000 customers in Comal County were without power. There was also some minor structural damage in Caldwell, Comal, and Lavaca Counties. Maximum rainfall totals in these counties ranged from 4.67 inches in Bexar to 29.19 in Fayette. Flooding and flash flooding forced 608 people to be evacuated from their homes. Most of these, 400, were in Fayette County.","Harvey moved across the Gulf of Mexico into the central Texas Coast during the last week of August. After the initial landfall, the cyclone moved back into the gulf a couple days later and then made another landfall in Southwest Louisiana during the morning of the 30th. The first rains from the system moved across the region during the afternoon of the 25th and finally ended during the morning of September 1. One to 5 feet of rain fell across Southeast Texas during the week which in some cases was slightly more than a normal yearly rainfall total. Widespread flooding occurred and a new rainfall record was set regarding the total for a tropical cyclone in the United States.","Harvey moved across the Gulf of Mexico into the central Texas Coast during the last week of August.
